For an art gallery inventory management system...

It seems that each piece would be pretty unique, like you probably wouldn't have
inventory in the traditional sense, like a warehouse, where you have 100 units
of something. Although, it would be possible to have multiple copies, I believe,
perhaps if you have reproductions of things? Although I think that would be
pretty rare.

For the entities, I would probably have a `Piece` entity, which just represents
a single art piece.

Artist:
- id
- first_name
- last_name
- bio

ArtPiece:
- id
- title
- artist
- release_date

Employee:
- id
- first_name
- last_name
- hire_date
- title

AuditLogEntry:
- action:string
- employee:references
- record:references
- before_state:text
- after_state:text
